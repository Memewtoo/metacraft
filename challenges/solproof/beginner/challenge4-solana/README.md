The create.tsx on Break Solana Game creates a reference object, which contains a function that creates and sends a transaction.

It uses a variety of hooks to fetch necessary information, some of the hooks used are
`useConnection` hook to establish a connection to the Solana blockchain,
`useBlockhash` hook to retrieve the latest blockhash,
`useDispatch` hook to get the dispatch function,
`useSocket` hook to get a `WebSocket` instance and the,
`useAccountState` hook to get information about the user's account.

Most of these hooks are used in the `CreateTxProvider` to create transactions and send them to the server via a `WebSocket`.

The `createTransaction` is responsible for actually creating and sending the transaction.

By this approach, I observed that a layer of abstraction has been added on the transactions on Break Solana Game.

Overall, when compared to the HelloWorld Program, I can say the Solana Break Game is high-level by abstracting the low-level details of creating and sending transations
while, HelloWorld seems to be a more a low-level and traditional way to create and send Solana transactions.
